# 3DObjects
3D CAD objects and related things for public consumption

For now, this source tree contains 'OpenSCAD' files for things that
I have done that I might deem 'convenient' for others to use, at least
as examples for how to use OpenSCAD for 3D Printing.

These files use a 'shrink factor' of 1.02 which is based on the measured
behavior of my particular printer using PLA.  Your Mileage May Vary.

Some of these are simple gears, demonstrating the ability to create useful
mechanical parts with a 3D printer.

One of them is of very practical use, a water bottle cap, for multi-gallon
water jugs.  The caps on those things go bad for some reason, but the bottles
themselves are perfectly fine.  Now you can replace the caps!
